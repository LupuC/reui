## Setup

<Steps>

### Install Radix Direction

Run the following command to add the Radix Direction provider to hande the direction support for your components:

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-direction
```

### Add RTL Support

Wrap your application with the `DirectionProvider` component.
This ensures that all components adapt their behavior according to the `dir` prop.

```tsx
import { DirectionProvider } from '@radix-ui/react-direction';

export default () => (
  <html dir="rtl">
    <body>
      <DirectionProvider dir="rtl">{/* Your app */}</DirectionProvider>
    </body>
  </html>
);
```

</Steps>
